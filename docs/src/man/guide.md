# Package Guide

## Installation

`PFlow` is a registered package **(not yet)** and so can be installed via:

```julia
Pkg.add("PFlow")
```

This package supports Julia `0.6`.

## Usage

`PFlow.jl` can be used in two ways:
- as a library containing elementary functions for writing generic discrete event
simulations in Julia
- as an engine with specialized functions for discrete event simulations of
product flow systems as in production, projects, service â€¦

### Generic use for discrete event simulations

`Pflow.jl` uses [Julia tasks](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/control-flow/#man-tasks-1)
for simulations. Proprietary simulation functions can be written as Julia functions,
started as tasks with `@async` or similar functions and can use `PFlow's`
simulation functions `delay` and `delayuntil` in order to be suspended until a
certain simulation time is reached.

Proprietary simulation functions or tasks, using `PFlow` in this way, have
to care for exception handling or logging for themselves. They can use all
other [Julia coroutine functionality](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/parallel-computing/#Scheduling-1)
and [library functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/stdlib/parallel/#Tasks-and-Parallel-Computing-1)
in order to coordinate and communicate with other tasks. You get the full Julia
stacktrace if an error occurs, which is good for development and debugging.

In order to use `PFlow's` simulation facilities, you have to
1. import first Pflow with `**using** PFlow`,
2. define a simulation variable with eg. `sim = DES()`,
3. write Julia functions importing the simulation variable as in `**function** myfunc(sim::DES, ...)`,
4. using the `PFlow` functions for relative `delay(sim::DES, time::Float64)` or
absolute `delayuntil(sim::DES, time::Float64)`,
5. start and schedule the proprietary simulation functions as tasks with `**@async** myfunc(sim, ...)`,
6. get them running asynchronously with eg. `yield()` or better `sleep(0.1)` and then
7. start the simulation for a certain simulation time with `simulate(sim, time)`.

The `simulate` function jumps from one discrete simulation time event to the next
as soon as it gets the control back from the Julia task scheduler. Therefore
proprietary tasks have to give back control to the Julia scheduler by finishing,
calling again `delay` or `delayuntil` or calling one of Julia's scheduling
functions such as `yield()`, `wait()`, `take!(ch)` or `put!(ch, x)` ...

### Specific use for simulation of product flow systems

`PFlow` provides a model kit for basic entities of production systems like

- work units,
- orders/jobs,
- materials/products.

Those entities are collected and described in lists (`.csv`-files) which
are read by `PFlow` in order to keep programming needs to a minimum. Utility
functions allow to run simulations and to visualize, document, store and
compare results.
