    "# Simulation of Production Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "*Paul Bayer, v0.2, 2017-08-22*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simulations of production systems and projects should show their main characteristics and effects. Therefore we have to consider the principal physical properties of their entities and how they depend on each other in order to create a system. Building on experience in analyzing and managing those systems I lay out a basic framework, with which production systems and projects can be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some remarks on simulation of work processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing and projects, simulations don’t have the weight they should have for operating and improving them. I see two main reasons for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are **not realistic enough** on a system level. They don’t reflect the main characteristics of the system.\n",
    "2. They are **too difficult** to build, to change and to operate. Usually, they cannot be built, modified and operated by operators and managers but only by external specialists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real production systems and projects therefore mostly are managed on daily experiences or heuristic rules drawn from much simpler models or even on blind guesses, but not on decisions checked by analyses and simulation after evaluating several alternatives. Analyses and simulations currently simply are **not good enough** (lacking accuracy, speed, simplicity) in order to inform the decisions of managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at common simulation systems, we see graphical model builders, which allow for the building of quite rigid models. They don’t have the flexibility to model, to represent and to compute varying and concurring orders and dependencies across resources. Models coming out of those simulation frameworks and approaches have a focus on the animation of singular transactions occurring in real systems or on proper arrangement of components, for selling systems to clients … but not on assessing and improving their overall and daily performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some decades (!) of repeatedly seeing new systems and projects fail and underperform, even after some simulation, my goal is to change the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I have first to introduce some [operational definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition) with which we can describe work processes sufficiently well in order to model and to simulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Work units\n",
    "\n",
    "I see only the following basic transactions (**jobs**):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Operation**: some modification of an item or combination with other items,\n",
    "2. **Transport**: moving an item from one instance to another,\n",
    "3. **Inspection**: checking an item without modifying it,\n",
    "4. **Delay**: waiting for release or some other instance to occur or be ready – in simulation this is not explicitly modeled, but results implicitly as queues,\n",
    "5. **Storage**: putting an item to some dedicated place since it is not currently needed by some other instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **products** transformed through those transactions are some configuration of\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy**,\n",
    "- **Material**,\n",
    "- **Information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A job is carried out in a **work unit**, which has\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name**,\n",
    "- **location** – the distance between instances is a basic factor of transport time other than disponibility of the transport instance,\n",
    "- **input queue** with a maximum capacity $\\ge 0$,\n",
    "- **output queue** with a maximum capacity $\\ge 0$,\n",
    "- **capacity** – it can operate on a defined number of items such and such fast, it is allowed, required or restricted to **multitask** on its items \n",
    "- **availability** – it is prone to disruptions and failures and must be maintained, (has a defined failure characteristic, eg. distribution, MTBF, MTTR),\n",
    "- **dependability** – it can impair the items,\n",
    "- **dependency** – it depends on energy, materials, equipment, and information which may or may not be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each work unit has characteristic states,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **idle**: there is no item to process,\n",
    "- **working**: currently working on an item,\n",
    "- **halted**: some breakdown has occurred and has to be fixed,\n",
    "- **blocked**: can not deliver the item because the output queue is full and the following transaction is ready,\n",
    "- **starved**: cannot process the item because a condition is not fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production system\n",
    "\n",
    "A **production system** consists of several work units, which can be combined in a sequence of jobs in order to process some product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product flow\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orders and project plans\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence in which the jobs are carried out is given by an **order**. Therefore an order is a description of a **sequence of jobs**. Orders are accompanying information to products. An order can only be started, if the necessary products for processing it, are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "An order describes, on which work units the jobs can be carried out (sometimes on several) and gives an estimate, how long it will take.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **project plan** can be seen as a sequence of orders (with some more uncertainty in execution time). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Products\n",
    "\n",
    "An order converts a raw product to a **new product**, which can be delivered or further processed (in another order). Finished products are always **stored** before processed further and carried on to new orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Products are the primary items** flowing through a system (production or projects) - and the main meaning of `PFlow` is **product flow**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scheduler** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. takes the available (raw) products, \n",
    "2. carries them through a sequence of jobs given by an order and thus \n",
    "3. converts them to a new finished or semi-finished product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be repeated in various stages, in which semi-finished products are combined or branched in sequential orders, so as to make finally a finished product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Master Production Schedule (MPS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_production_schedule) is the \n",
    "\n",
    "1. input of product items, \n",
    "2. combined with orders,\n",
    "3. into a production system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler then carries the products through the system until they are are finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Source and sink\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of any production system we have a **source**, delivering the MPS to the scheduler. At the end of the production system we have a **sink**, collecting the finished products for delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variation and policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution times for jobs and failures of work units are prone to variation, which we have to specify as an input to simulation (as part of our model). The [following paper](https://github.com/pbayer/PFlow.jl/blob/master/docs/notebooks/04%20Variation%20in%20Projects%20and%20Production.ipynb) describes, how this can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accompanying orders describe the sequence, how the products are to be processed. For parallel work units the sequence is decided by the scheduler depending on their availability and on the input queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waiting times and queue lengths before work units can vary wildly depending on their work load, availability and buffer sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Policies can further modify the flow of products through a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multitasking (is it allowed, expected or restrained),\n",
    "- batch processing,\n",
    "- priority based scheduling,\n",
    "- buffer policies (Kanban …)\n",
    "- release scheduling (CONWIP, DBR …)\n",
    "\n",
    "are some of the major influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simulation and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the inputs like available work units, orders, variation in execution times and failures, policies … simulation can then show, which **constraints** emerge and can be worked on in order to improve the system."
