    "# Basic Entities of Work Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "*Paul Bayer, 2017-08-20*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simulations of production systems and projects should show their main characteristics and effects. Therefore we have to consider the principal physical properties of their entities and how they depend on each other in order to create a system. Building on experience in analyzing and managing those systems I lay out a basic framework, with which production systems and projects can be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some remarks on simulation of work processes\n",
    "\n",
    "In manufacturing and projects, simulations don’t have the weight they should have for operating and improving them. I see two main reasons for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They are **not realistic enough** on a system level. They don’t reflect the main characteristics of the system.\n",
    "2. They are **too difficult** to build, to change and to operate. Usually, they cannot be built, modified and operated by operators and managers but only by external specialists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real production systems and projects therefore mostly are managed on daily experiences or heuristic rules drawn from much simpler models or even on blind guesses, but not on decisions checked by analyses and simulation after evaluating several alternatives. Analyses and simulations currently simply are **not good enough** (lacking accuracy, speed, simplicity) in order to inform the decisions of managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at common simulation systems, we see graphical model builders, which allow for the building of quite rigid models. They don’t have the flexibility to model, to represent and to compute varying and concurring orders and dependencies across resources. Models coming out of those simulation frameworks and approaches have a focus on the animation of singular transactions occurring in real systems or on proper arrangement of components, for selling systems to clients … but not on assessing and improving their overall and daily performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some decades (!) of repeatedly seeing new systems and projects fail and underperform, even after some simulation, my goal is to change the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now – and following an age old process analysis technique – I see only the following basic transactions (jobs), with which workflows can be described and therefore modeled:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Operation**: some modification of an item or combination with other items,\n",
    "2. **Transport**: moving an item from one instance to another,\n",
    "3. **Inspection**: checking an item without modifying it,\n",
    "4. **Delay**: waiting for release or some other instance to occur or be ready – this in simulation normally is not explicitly modeled, but implicitly as queues,\n",
    "5. **Storage**: putting an item to some dedicated place since it is not currently needed by some other instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The items processed in those instances can be each some amount, form or configuration of\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Energy**,\n",
    "- **Material**,\n",
    "- **Information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction needs a resource to be carried out, which has\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name**,\n",
    "- **location** – the distance between instances is a basic factor of transport time other than disponibility of the transport instance,\n",
    "- **input queue** with a maximum capacity $\\ge 0$,\n",
    "- **output queue** with a maximum capacity $\\ge 0$,\n",
    "- **capacity** – it can operate on a defined number of items such and such fast, it is allowed, required or restricted to **multitask** on its items \n",
    "- **availability** – it is prone to disruptions and failures and must be maintained, (has a defined failure characteristic, eg. distribution, MTBF, MTTR),\n",
    "- **dependability** – it can impair the items,\n",
    "- **dependency** – it depends on energy, materials, equipment, and information which may or may not be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each resource has characteristic states,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **idle**: there is no item to process,\n",
    "- **working**: currently working on an item,\n",
    "- **halted**: some breakdown has occurred and has to be fixed,\n",
    "- **blocked**: can not deliver the item because the output queue is full and the following transaction is ready,\n",
    "- **starved**: cannot process the item because a condition is not fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flow through those instances\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence in which those elementary jobs are carried out is given by an **order**. Therefore an order is a description of a **sequence of jobs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Products\n",
    "\n",
    "An order converts a raw product to a **new product**, which can be delivered or further processed in another order. We can safely assume (for modeling and simulation), that products are always **stored** before processed further and combined with new orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since orders require some material, which is the **product of a preceding process or order**, an order can only be started, if the necessary products for processing it, are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Products are therefore the primary items** flowing through a system (production or projects) - and the main meaning of `PFlow` is product flow. Orders are accompanying information which tells the system how products are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, what the scheduling is all about: it 1) takes the available (raw) products, 2) carries them through a sequence of jobs given by an order and thus 3) converts them to a new finished or semi-finished product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be repeated in various stages, in which semi-finished products are combined or branched in sequential orders, so as to make finally a finished product."
