    "# A Post Office â€“ A Real Life Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with an everyday story: there is a small post office with one clerk serving the arriving customers. Customers have differing wishes leading to different serving times, from ```1 - 5 minutes```. We have to add a little variation to serving times counting for variation in customer habits and clerk performance. The arrival rate of customers is about 18 per hour, every ```3.33 minutes``` or ```3 minutes, 20 seconds``` on average. Our post office is small and customer patience is limited, so queue length is limited to 5 customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided 10% extra capacity, so our expectation is that there should not be too many customers discouraged for long waiting times or for full queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a simulation in [```Julia```](https://julialang.org) using [```SimJulia```](https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl). We need \n",
    "\n",
    "1. a source: all the people, providing an unlimited supply for customers,\n",
    "2. customers with their demands and their limited patience,\n",
    "3. a queue and\n",
    "4. our good old clerk."
