    "Let us begin with an everyday story: there is a small post office with one clerk serving the arriving customers. Customers have differing wishes leading to different serving times, from `1 - 5 minutes`. We have to add a little variation to serving times counting for variation in customer habits and clerk performance. The arrival rate of customers is about 18 per hour, every `3.33 minutes` or `3 minutes, 20 seconds` on average. Our post office is small and customer patience is limited, so queue length is limited to 5 customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided 10% extra capacity, so our expectation is that there should not be too many customers discouraged for long waiting times or for full queues.\n",

    "1. a source: all the **people**, providing an unlimited supply for customers,\n",
    "2. **customers** with their demands and their limited patience,\n",
    "3. a **queue** and\n",
    "4. our good old **clerk**."

    "We did run the simulation `600` minutes. `188` customers came, `159` customers were served, `19` left beforehand because the queue was full. Many customers had waiting times of more than 10, 15 up to even 20 minutes.\n",

Even more so for more complicated systems in production, service, projects and supply chains with multiple dependencies.\n",

    "This is what this Repository `PFlow` is all about: to **check assumptions by means of simulation** and to see what may happen beforehand and to get processes and systems flow before they fail to deliver their expected outcomes. It is clear that it must be **easier** to do than to write programs in Julia and to read and interpret long lists as demonstrated. The objective of this repository is to provide a simple framework for such tasks."
