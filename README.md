# PFlow.jl

### Simulation of Production Systems and Projects

`PFlow.jl` is a `Julia` library, which simulates the main physical characteristics of production systems and projects:

- processing of orders,
- in given sequences,
- taking different and varying processing times and
- through different workunits, 
- which are prone to failures.

Often several resources are available for doing a job, sometimes orders have to compete for certain resources. Sometimes components or other prerequisites are required in order to process orders. Sometimes there are physical or policy limits to buffer sizes. Multitasking may be required or restricted â€¦ There are **multiple dependencies** which have to be simulated in order to get system level characteristics like

- utilization,
- throughput,
- cost.

All this is achieved by simple parametrization and lists of

- orders,
- workunits,
- materials

which are the basis of production systems or projects and are usually handled by MRP or project management systems.

`Julia` (with `SimJulia`) is maturing and can provide for a really fast simulation library, capable to simulate also medium to large systems as in production, in automotive plants or in multiprojects.

### Status of Project (as of 08/2017)

PFlow is in early development. Things are coming together quite quickly and a working prototype and some interesting results should be available in this repository by September 2017.
